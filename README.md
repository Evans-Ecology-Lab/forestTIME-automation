This repository automates monthly production and release of annualized tables created with the [`forestTIME` package](https://github.com/Evans-Ecology-Lab/forestTIME).
Get the data from the most recent [Zenodo archive](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17088642).

### Editing Metadata

If you'd like to add authors, change the title, etc. this should be done directly on the zenodo record.
Create a new version, make edits, and publish.
This workflow copies the metatdata from the latest version and only updates the version number and publication date.
